# Overview

Recursion actually is a broad concept which resides in the intersection of many fields such as mathematics, computer science, linguistics and etc. For us it is a problem which can be divided into smaller similar problems and has two distinct cases: *base* and *recursive* cases.

* [Assiut University Training - Sheet #7 (Recursion)](https://codeforces.com/group/MWSDmqGsZm/contest/223339). This is the list of common recursion problems. Try to solve it [here](./assiut_sheet_7/).
* [Labuladong Algo Notes | Reverse Linked List Recursion](https://labuladong.online/algo/en/data-structure/reverse-linked-list-recursion/) . A brilliant resource on topic. 

* [CS106B Programming Abstractions in C++ (Stanford)](https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs106b/cs106b.1126/)
Great introduction to recursion in 4 parts.
* [Recursion and Linked Lists](https://www.cs.bu.edu/fac/snyder/cs112/CourseMaterials/LinkedListNotes.Recursion.html)
"These notes collect together a number of important recursive algorithms operating on linked lists."
